Scenerio Information:

The interactive media scene is a Labyrinth game where the player has to traverse through an auto generated labyrinth like area while hunting down enemies that proactively flee from and evade the player. The scene has two distinct game modes: countdown and time trial. Countdown has the player trying to reach a certain score before the time runs out and time trial allows the player to reach that same score goal but in as much time as they need. The enemies present will evade the player and to make it extra difficult, if they run into a run they will hop over it, something the player cannot do. The scene is simplistic in nature however this aspect makes it much harder to complete the goal as enemies are able to completely get out of the labyrinth causing the player to have to wait for more to spawn.
